# Branch-Prediction-Simulator
This project deals with building a C++ based simulator that models dynamic branch prediction in a pipelined processor.
Three types of prediction namely "Bimodal", "Gshare" and "Hybrid" models are built based on the command line arguments. Please the spec in this folder for further details.

The performance in prediction accuracy is observed for different predictor models and various benchmark traces. The graphs plotted indicate the facts.
